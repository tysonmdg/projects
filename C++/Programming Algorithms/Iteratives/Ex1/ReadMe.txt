This code checks if all the positions of one vector [0..p] (p included) are lower (strict) than all the others [p+1..n-1]. 

You have to enter an integer number that indicates a number of test cases. 
On each case, you have to indicate the size of the vector and the position. Then, indicate the vector values.

For each case, it indicates if its true or false the restriction (SI or NO).

Example input:
